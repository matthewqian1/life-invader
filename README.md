# Life Invader App

## Background
I am creating a fitness app which tracks calorie consumption and goals. In the past I have found the benefit of being mindful of this to lose weight and now I want to create an app which acts as a clear tracker for this measurement. Im hoping to expand this to add more features and functionality to create a seamless user experience. My first real project using frontend coding too, a bit rough on the edges with this but learning as I go :) 

## Tech Stack
### Frontend
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
### Backend
- Spring Boot Java
- MongoDB

## Improvements/Future Considerations
- Layout/Design/Colouring
- Add future consumption recommendations based on current progress (food recs/future calorie breakdown)
- Social media/network features (posts/likes/friends)
- Web scraping for health news
