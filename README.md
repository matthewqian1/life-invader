# Life Invader App

## Background
I am creating a fitness app which tracks calorie consumption and goals. In the past I have found the benefit of being mindful of this to lose weight and now I want to create an app which acts as a clear tracker for this measurement. Im hoping to expand this to add more features and functionality to create a seamless user experience. My first real project using frontend coding too, a bit rough on the edges with this but learning as I go :) You can check it out here https://life-invader-ui-8f3ba75e3e79.herokuapp.com/
